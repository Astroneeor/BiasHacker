    "biases": "Avoid attributing symptoms presented by Black patients solely to stress, as this can lead to underdiagnosis and inadequate treatment plans. It's crucial to thoroughly investigate their symptoms rather than dismissing them based on preconceived notions about race and stress. Similarly, do not overlook men's chronic pain due to biases that suggest they should be more resilient or handle pain better; this can result in misdiagnosis or the provision of inadequate care. Additionally, be cautious of assuming that older patients have diminished capacities for understanding their health issues; this could lead to underestimating their symptoms and failing to provide the appropriate care they deserve. Always strive for a comprehensive approach to patient assessment, regardless of demographic factors."
