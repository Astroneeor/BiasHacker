    "biases": "Do not assume that transgender and non-binary patients are seeking care for issues unrelated to their gender identity, as this can lead to mistrust and prevent them from receiving adequate care. Always treat their health concerns seriously and validate their symptoms without prejudice. Avoid attributing the symptoms of Black patients solely to stress or socioeconomic factors; instead, provide thorough examinations and consider a wide range of potential underlying medical issues. Additionally, do not stereotype patients based on their race or gender identity, as this can lead to significant misdiagnoses or inadequate treatment options. Always approach each patient as an individual with unique experiences and health needs."
