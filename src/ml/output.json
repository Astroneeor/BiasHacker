    "biases": "Do not assume that transgender and non-binary patients are seeking care for issues related to their gender identity alone. This bias can lead to inadequate treatment and dismiss their legitimate health concerns, which may not be related to their gender identity at all. Always listen to their symptoms and take their health complaints seriously without prejudice. \n\nAvoid the pitfall of attributing Black patients' health concerns solely to stress or socio-economic factors, which can lead to misdiagnosis and under-treatment. It's critical to evaluate their symptoms with the same rigor and empathy as you would for any other patient, ensuring that underlying medical issues are identified and treated appropriately. \n\nDo not stereotype patients based on race or gender identity by making assumptions about their lifestyle, behavior, or likelihood of certain conditions. Each patient deserves an individualized assessment, as these stereotypes can lead to significant gaps in care and a lack of trust in the healthcare system, ultimately affecting health outcomes."
